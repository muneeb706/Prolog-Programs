# Prolog Programs
Solutions of Logic in Computer Science problems in Prolog. Following are descriptions of implemented programs

## Insertion Sort: 
Implemention of the insertion sort, isort(X, Y), where X is a list of integers and Y is the result of sorting X.

## Selection Sort:
Implemention of the selection sort, ssort(X, Y), where X is a list of integers and Y is the result of sorting X.

## Propostional Formula to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form):
Implementation of a Prolog program which converts a propositional formula into CNF. That is, provide an implementation of transCNF(X, Y) in Prolog, where X is a propositional formula and Y is the CNF equivalent formula to X.
